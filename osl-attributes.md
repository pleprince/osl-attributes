# Common attributes standardisation

Version 0.1

## Motivation

OSL has been tremendously successful at standardising shading but there are still non standardised areas, especially around each rendererâ€™s internal nomenclature.
Although the same compiled shaders can run in any renderer, it is difficult in 2024 to write a shader that performs correctly in multiple renderers because each renderer names primitive attributes differently.

For example, if you wish to use the surface tangent:

| Renderer | OSL call |
| -: | :- |
| ![RenderMan]( https://img.shields.io/badge/RenderMan-blue) | `getattribute("Tn", tangent)` |
| ![Arnold]( https://img.shields.io/badge/Arnold-teal) | `Vector tangent = normalize(dPdu)` |
| ![!Vray](https://img.shields.io/badge/VRay-yellow) | `Vector tangent = normalize(dPdu)` |
| ![Cycles]( https://img.shields.io/badge/Cycles-orange) | `getattribute("geom:tangent", tangent)` |
| ![RedShift]( https://img.shields.io/badge/Redshift-red) | `Vector tangent = normalize(dPdu)` |

In this case, the shader writer hopes that u, v is not the parametric uv on meshes, otherwise dPdu may be pretty useless. But there is no guarantee.

## Renderer identification

Note that we have no way to tell which renderer is executing our code. I think this would be useful as there are other types of discrepancies that need to be taken care of by shader writers.

This could be fixed by adding 2 standard attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|- | - | - |
| `"renderer:name"` | string | lower-case name i.e. `"renderman"` |
| `"renderer:version"` | int[2] | [major, minor] i.e. `[26, 2]` |

## Standard attribute names

Here is a list of proposed names for common attributes, inspired by various sources.

### Geometry

> [!NOTE]
> some of these positions could be globals (Po, Non, Tn, etc).

| Attribute | Type | Description | Could be a global ? |
| - | - | - | - |
| `"geom:uv"` | float[2] | The default UV set | |
| `"geom:tangent"` | vector | The normalised surface tangent [^1] | &#10004; |
| `"geom:bitangent"` | vector | The normalised surface bitangent [^1] | &#10004; |
| `"geom:undisplaced_P"` | point | The surface position before displacement | &#10004; |
| `"geom:undisplaced_N"` | normal | The surface normal before displacement | &#10004; |

[^1]: Should always return a usable vector, even if there is no explicit surface parameterization, i.e. no UVs.
